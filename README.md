# Code & Data for Replication of 'Training a Diffusion Model to Create Biometrically Unique Iris Textures'.
This repository includes all necessiary code to replicate the work performed in 'Training a Diffusion Model to Create Biometrically Unique Iris Textures'. Additionally, it contains some of the data required for replication; however, protected data is only availible upon request.

* 1-Diffusion: This part of the repository includes the instructions for installing OpenAI's 'Guided Diffusion' framework; parameters for training our model and sampling from our model; and model fit statistics. Data is not included; however, it availible upon request.
* 2-Recognition: Includes all of the code & instructions required to perform feature extraction from our iris images and make hamming distance comparisons.
* 3-Analyses: All data and statistical analyses performed that support the paper's conclusions.
