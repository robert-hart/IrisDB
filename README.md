# Code & Data for Replication of 'Training a Diffusion Model to Create Biometrically Unique Iris Textures'.
This repository includes all necessiary code to replicate the work performed in 'Training a Diffusion Model to Create Biometrically Unique Iris Textures'. Additionally, it contains some of the data required for replication; however, protected data is only availible upon request.

* GuidedDiffusion: This part of the repository includes the instructions for installing OpenAI's 'Guided Diffusion' framework; parameters for training our model and sampling from our model; and model fit statistics. Data is not included; however, it availible upon request.
* iris-evaluation: The Python package for all analyses performed.
* Data & Analyses: Coming soon

# TODO

* ~~Convert from csv interpretation to JSON interpretation~~
* ~~Implement algorithms for decidability, SSIM, & 'linear' Hamming~~
* ~~Add calibrate routine~~ not actually needed right now
* Final tidying up
* Instructions
